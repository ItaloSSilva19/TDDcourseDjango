## Links to the Content:
[This is the youtube video's link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rLPDxpXIFc) that I used to generate the files of this repo from the chapter 1 to 4 of the book  
[This is the book's link ](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/pre-requisite-installations.html)that I'm using to learn about TDD and Django.

## More information

Both in the video and in the book there are the step-by-step on how to configurate and run the tutorial. Be free to check it out.

In these tutorials it's shown how to use selenium and the Django pytest to use the TDD methodology applied to the web development context.

## Where I'm at now:

Now I'm finished with the chapter 4 and going to start chapter 5.
